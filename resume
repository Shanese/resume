					<p><em><span>It is my belief that I possess qualities that 	will allow me to add more value to your program.
					A part of my training includes the knowledge of technology. I have also held  leadership positions which have helped me to develop my ability to work with others and to do so with professionalism. I am a willing, open minded and capable individual, and I hold myself to the highest ethical standards. 
					For these reasons I seek to become a part of your organization, and desire that given the opportunity to work with you I will learn and develop my skills to the benefit of myself and your institution.</span></em></p>
